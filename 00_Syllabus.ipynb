    "## Course Description from Bulletin ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This course develops the principles of geophysical computing in the context of simulating and validating numerical solutions to the types of partial differential equations commonly found in geophysical investigations (e.g., potential fields, heat flow/diffusion, seismic wave propagation). Students are introduced to architecture of modern computing systems and learn how algorithms can be developed to leverage this architecture to efficiently generate numerical solutions to multidimensional geophysical problems using parallel computing methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This graduate course applies the analytical and numerical/computational geophysics skills acquired during undergraduate programs to common problems in geophysical computing. Major objectives of the course include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students will understand and be able to apply concepts of computing in the context of solving complex geophysical problem, many involving field data.\n",
    "2. Students will develop practical programming skills and combine with knowledge of numerical algorithms to solve real-world geophysical problems.\n",
    "3. Students will develop independent research skills by undertaking a project involving a substantial piece of analytic, numerical and computation work involving solving a real-world geophysical problem\n",
    "4. Independently design, develop, validate and apply computer programs to solve geophysical data analysis and numerical modeling tasks, largely using a lower-level language (e.g., C/C++/F90).  Some course sections will use the Python language and its associated tool kits (i.e., Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Policy on academic integrity and misconduct ##  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Colorado School of Mines affirms the principle that all individuals associated with the Mines academic community have a responsibility for establishing, maintaining an fostering an understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. In broad terms, this implies protecting the environment of mutual trust within which scholarly exchange occurs, supporting the ability of the faculty to fairly and effectively evaluate every student’s academic achievements, and giving credence to the university’s educational mission, its scholarly objectives and the substance of the degrees it awards. The protection of academic integrity requires there to be clear and consistent standards, as well as confrontation and sanctions when individuals violate those standards. The Colorado School of Mines desires an environment free of any and all forms of academic misconduct and expects students to act with integrity at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic misconduct is the intentional act of fraud, in which an individual seeks to claim credit for the work and efforts of another without authorization, or uses unauthorized materials or fabricated information in any academic exercise. Student Academic Misconduct arises when a student violates the principle of academic integrity. Such behavior erodes mutual trust, distorts the fair evaluation of academic achievements, violates the ethical code of behavior upon which education and scholarship rest, and undermines the credibility of the university. Because of the serious institutional and individual ramifications, student misconduct arising from violations of academic integrity is not tolerated at Mines. If a student is found to have engaged in such misconduct sanctions such as change of a grade, loss of institutional privileges, or academic suspension or dismissal may be imposed.\n",
