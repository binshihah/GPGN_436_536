    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the modern professional geophysicists, the use of computers and algorithms is ubiquitous in all aspects of the daily routine.  Whether using a \"canned\" commercial geophysical software application to or developing new code to address a particular task, employing/implementing some sort of computational algorithm is almost always at the heart of any geophysical task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge of canned software\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key challenges geophysicsts face when using commercial geophysical software is that it is often difficult to determine what is going on \"under the hood\".  In many instances it may seem that geophysical results are found in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Field}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Magic\\,Black}\\\\\\mathrm{Box\\,of\\, Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Data\\,Processing}\\end{array}}\n",
    "\\Longrightarrow \n",
    "\\boxed{\\begin{array}{c}\\mathrm{Top-notch}\\\\\\mathrm{Geophysical}\\\\\\mathrm{Result}\\end{array}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often there are numerous parameters that go into the blackbox, various combinations of which can greatly affect the output results! It can be extremely frustrating for users - especially when the documentation and usage examples cannot be found, and there is no open-source code to help figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python, Scientific Libraries and Beyond ...\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major goals of this course is to strip away some of the **magic black box** nature of how students are commonly introduced to geophysical computing, and to provide a better conceptual idea of what is going on when software is applied to tackle geophysical problems.  That said, it is not our goal to \"reinvent the wheel\" on absolutely every algorithm because this would take far too long and one would never finish finding solutions to the problem at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we are taking in this course tries to find a middle way.  In particular, the notes will focus on the **Python** language and leverage its open-source, diverse and well-validated computational toolkits including **Numpy** and **Scipy** as well as the strong plotting library **Matplotlib**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to fully appreciate the theory behind some of these tools, it is important to code up some algorithms by oneself to help deepen the understanding of just what the algorithm is doing. Moreover, there will be scenarios where one has to develop a full computer program for a specialized task for which no community-based solution exists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, Python may not be the optimal language in which to develop and thus there will be the need to include algorithms directly embedded into the code. In particular, when dealing with large-scale 3D geophysical computing problems, it is highly desirable to develop **parallel computing** solutions that allow you to leverage modern computational hardware to solve these problem in a fraction of the time that **serial computing** solutions will take. Having a deeper understanding of the geophysical algoritms will be greatly helpful in these scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will begin to explore these more advanced concepts using the student's choice of [\"low-level\" programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming) C/C++/F90 and [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). Overall, it is our hope that this will assist students in designing better geophysical computing solutions for read-world three-dimensional (3-D) problems that will facilitate achievement of the student's geophysical research and data processing goals."
